\# Retail Sales Forecasting \& Inventory Optimization



\## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmartâ€™s historical retail sales data to \*\*forecast future sales\*\* and \*\*optimize inventory planning\*\*.  

It follows an end-to-end \*\*data analytics workflow\*\* â€” from \*\*data cleaning (ETL)\*\* to \*\*feature engineering\*\*, \*\*EDA\*\*, and \*\*predictive modeling\*\*.



The goal is to build \*\*data-driven insights\*\* that help retailers:

\- Anticipate demand fluctuations

\- Avoid stockouts \& overstocking

\- Improve supply chain efficiency

\- Increase profitability

## ðŸš€ Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights from EDA
- Seasonal patterns in sales, with spikes during holiday periods
- Temperature, fuel prices, and CPI show potential correlation with sales
- Rolling averages and lag features improve forecasting accuracy

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Train time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- Build an interactive dashboard for inventory decision-making
- Automate ETL pipeline for real-time sales data
